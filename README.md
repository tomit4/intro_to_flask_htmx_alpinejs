### A Introduction To Flask, HTMX, AlpineJS (with SQLite)

This is a short introduction to Flask, HTMX, and AlpineJS (with SQLite to be used for data storage)

Follow this [basic introduction](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/quickstart/).

To start python venv:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

And to end:

```
deactivate
```

To start, simply:

```
python index.py
```

**TODO**:

- [ ] Create GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE Routes to html files for now.
- [ ] Eventually connect flask to sqlite.
- [ ] Create client in htmx, AlpineJS
- [ ] Have client influence jinja templating and return back to htmx
- [ ] Make Something with it
